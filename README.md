# Prompt Engineering: Analyzing Developer-ChatGPT Interactions

## Overview
This capstone project focuses on the interaction between developers and ChatGPT, analyzing various aspects of these interactions. Our study aims to provide insights into the nature of developer queries, response effectiveness, and the potential for optimizing developer-AI collaboration.

## Contents
1. **Notebook**: Contains all the code and analysis conducted for this project.
2. **Data Set (Initial Preprocessing)**: The dataset Final_data.csv includes the raw data collected, along with initial preprocessing steps applied to make it suitable for analysis.
3. **Data Set (Final)**: The dataset English_Prompt_Data.csv is processed dataset post extensive analysis, ready for final interpretations and conclusions.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before diving into the notebook, make sure you have the following libraries and tools installed:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- re
- langdetect
- spacy
- TextBlob
- wordcloud
- seaborn
- numpy
- nltk

### Installation
If you don't have these libraries installed, you can typically install them using pip or conda, for example:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib langdetect spacy textblob wordcloud seaborn numpy nltk
```

## Running the Notebook
To run the notebook successfully, follow these steps:

Open the notebook file in your preferred Python environment.
Execute the cells sequentially to perform data analysis, visualization, and draw insights.
Feel free to experiment with the code and analyses to further explore the developer-ChatGPT interactions.
